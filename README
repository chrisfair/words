This is whitaker's words and it is quite simply the best Latin 
dictionary ever to be put in code form.  Since William Whitaker died a 
few years ago I have become concerned that his code may vanish from the 
earth so I have added it to this repostitory in hopes that it will be
propagated into the future.  I am going to set it up into autoconf
and autotools so that it might get absorbed into the various Linux 
distros and hopefully even BSD Unix.  To my mind WindBlows is irrelavent
as a platform but if anyone wants to fork this for WindBlows be my guest.


The instructions for basic make follow (for LINUX)

gnatmake words
gnatmake makedict
gnatmake makestem
gnatmake makeefil
gnatmake makeinfl

Now type the following

./makedict DICTLINE.GEN
./makestem STEMLIST.GEN
./makeefil EWDSLIST.GEN
./makeinfl INLECTS.SEC


Once that is complete typeing 
./words will enter you into the program...for anyone who is into Latin
magic follows for those of you who are not...well you won't care.
